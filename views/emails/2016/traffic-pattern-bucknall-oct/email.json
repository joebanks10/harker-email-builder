Due to heavy attendance of this event and a need to improve our neighborhood relations, we will be altering the format of the parade and parties for this school year. On Oct. 28 K-grade 3 will be having their parties and parade mid-morning before lunch, while grades 4-5 will have their Halloween celebration in the afternoon after lunch. More specific details will follow in an email from Kim Cali.

                                        Due to consternation within the neighboring community, parking on any of the auxiliary streets of Bucknall campus will not be an option for this event. Once the field is full you will be directed to an overflow lot which is two minutes away on McCoy and Weston, where a Harker bus will shuttle you to campus for this event. Due to the size of this event it’s imperative that you either park on the field or at the overflow lot so that our neighbors are not disrupted in any way.",

                                        Just like any other school day, for the health and safety of you and your child, follow all parking regulations such as using the crosswalks, only making right turns as you exit the loading zones, paying attention to the traffic personnel and not making U-turns into the driveways of private residences."
