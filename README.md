## Instructions

1. Copy the Starter email folder in the 'emails/' folder.
2. Rename the new folder to reflect the name of your email.
3. Open 'index.php' and define the URLs for the email's stylesheet and the images directory.
4. Open 'layout.html' and...
    - define the title of the email,
    - include the modules you'd like to use

5. For each module, open the module's file in the 'modules/' directory and edit the options.
    - to add a background color to a module, add 'color-bg purple-bg' to the 'classes' option -- background color classes are defined in the stylesheet.

6. To view the email in the browser, go to the email folder's URL (e.g. http://localhost/email-builder/emails/_starter/). 
    - To inline the styles, add '?inline' to the end of the URL (e.g. http://localhost/email-builder/emails/_starter/?inline).
    - Copy the page source to transfer the HTML code.
